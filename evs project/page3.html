                <h2 class="section-title">Impact of Climate Change on Biodiversity</h2>
                <p>Climate change has a profound effect on biodiversity, altering ecosystems and threatening species across the planet. Key impacts include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Habitat Loss:</strong> Rising temperatures, changing rainfall patterns, and extreme weather events such as droughts, floods, and wildfires are destroying habitats and pushing species into new, often unsuitable areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>Shifting Migration Patterns:</strong> Many species are shifting their ranges in response to temperature changes. This can cause mismatches in the timing of seasonal events like migration, pollination, and reproduction.</li>
                    <li><strong>Ocean Acidification:</strong> The increasing levels of CO2 in the atmosphere are also being absorbed by oceans, leading to acidification that harms marine life, particularly coral reefs, shellfish, and other marine organisms that rely on calcium carbonate for their shells and skeletons.</li>
                    <li><strong>Threatened Ecosystems:</strong> Climate change is exacerbating the pressures on fragile ecosystems, such as coral reefs, Arctic tundra, and rainforests. When ecosystems collapse, it impacts all species that depend on them, leading to cascading effects throughout the food chain.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="section-title">Solutions and Mitigation</h2>
                <p>While the effects of climate change are undeniable, there are solutions and actions we can take to mitigate the impacts and protect biodiversity. Some key strategies include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions:</strong> One of the most critical actions is reducing carbon emissions to slow down climate change. This can be achieved through renewable energy adoption, energy efficiency, and transitioning to sustainable transportation systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Creating and Expanding Protected Areas:</strong> Increasing the number and size of protected areas can help safeguard ecosystems and provide refuges for species that are threatened by climate change. This also helps preserve critical ecosystem services like carbon sequestration and water purification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Restoring Degraded Ecosystems:</strong> Restoring damaged ecosystems, such as wetlands, forests, and grasslands, can enhance biodiversity and improve the resilience of these areas to climate impacts. Restoration projects also help store carbon, improving the planet’s carbon balance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate-Smart Agriculture:</strong> Implementing farming practices that are adapted to changing climate conditions—such as agroforestry, crop diversification, and soil conservation—can help reduce environmental impacts and improve food security.</li>
                    <li><strong>Raising Awareness and Education:</strong> Engaging communities, governments, and businesses in biodiversity conservation and climate action through education and outreach is essential. Public awareness can drive policy change, inspire individual action, and foster global cooperation.</li>
